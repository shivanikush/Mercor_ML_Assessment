Clothing Similarity Search
Overview:

The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model capable of receiving text describing a clothing item and returning a ranked list of links to similar items from different websites. Your solution must be a function deployed on Google Cloud that accepts a text string and returns JSON responses with ranked suggestions.



Steps:

1. Collect and preprocess data.

-Use web scraping tools to gather a dataset of clothing item descriptions.

-Preprocess the text data by cleaning it.

2. Measure similarity.

-Develop a method for extracting useful features from the text descriptions.

-Compute the similarity between the input text and the texts in your database. 

3. Return ranked results.

-Design a function that accepts a text string, extracts its features, computes similarities with the items in the database, ranks them based on similarity, and returns the URLs of the top-N most similar items.

4. Deploy the function.

-Deploy your function on Google Cloud Functions or Google Cloud Run.
